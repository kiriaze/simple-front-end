					How does the SurfPool work?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Wave Loch is the only surf pool manufacturer that can simultaneously create expert and
							beginner waves at the same time. With a single burst of wave energy, we create two wave
							sections that break along the pool. The primary break, which is the larger and more advanced
							wave, breaks first (either left, right or as an A-frame) and as it travels through the pool it reforms
							into a smaller beginner wave that breaks closer to shore.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Wave Loch SurfPool uses a pneumatic air plunging system to create the wave energy and
							the wave is created by a specially-designed pool floor that allows the primary and secondary
							waves to be formed, and to dissipate the excess wave energy. This is the key to creating a
							highly efficient and profitable surf pool, where waves roll cleanly through the pool without
							producing backwash.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div data-id="" class="simple-accordion">
				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Why choose Wave Loch Surfpools vs any other competitor?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Simply put, we can produce more waves per minute than anyone else. Driving more revenue than any other solution. Plus, we do it with less energy cost, so Wave Loch Surf Pools are more cost effective. We have the ability to produce one wave every eight seconds whereas our closest competitors can only produce one wave per minute.
						</p>
						<p>
							Wave Loch understands your business model like no one else. W have over 25 years experience of building artificial surf technologies. We invented the popular FlowRider sheet-wave attraction, now installed over 30 countries with over 185 installations and counting.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also have direct expertise in venue design, real estate development and operations. We are uniquely experienced in the direct operation of parks, attractions and multi-component themed-venues. We will guide you to the best possible profitability and efficiency for your venue.
						</p>

			<div data-id="" class="simple-accordion">
				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					How big are the waves?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							On the V-Series, the primary wave is optimized to be 1.5m high. On the VX-Series, the primary wave is optimized for 2m. The secondary waves are roughly half the height of the primary wave.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div data-id="" class="simple-accordion">
				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Can we adjust the wave height?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Yes. The SurfPool is optimized to run most efficiently at it’s designated wave height but it can be adjusted.
							The advantage of a Wave Loch SurfPool is that it generates multiple waves of varying heights and shapes with a single burst of energy. Different waves can be designed to break at different heights throughout the pool.

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					How much does a Wave Loch SurfPool cost?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Building an artificial wave pool is not something you just put in your backyard (unless your back yard happens to be a huge ranch). The process of creating a new surf pool comes with a lot of variables and challenges such as regulatory complexities, infrastructure improvements, long timelines, multiple partners and a lot of perseverance and commitment. As much as we love building waves, we prefer to work with robust clients that have experience in real estate development. But to be more precise… it’ll cost more than your Ferrari but less than your private jet. Call us to get more info.

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					How many waves per minute can a Wave Loch SurfPool produce?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Our system can produce a maximum of eight waves per minute or 480 waves per hour. This is more than eight times the amount of waves than any other system on the market. We bang more waves for your buck.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div data-id="" class="simple-accordion">
				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					How many people can ride at a time?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Depending on the model, up to five surfers at a time. Our SurfPools are always custom-built so depending on your venue’s needs we can increase the capacity to whatever you’d like.

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					What type of waves can you make?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Wave Loch has the ability, depending on the model, to create perfect A-frames, left or right point breaks, beach breaks or any surf break you can imagine.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div data-id="" class="simple-accordion">
				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Do you use regular pool water or salt water?

					What are the space requirements for a Wave Loch Surf Pool?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							The smallest model is about 1.5 acres. There is no limit on maximum size, we love to go big!

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Can we heat the water in your pools?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Yes we could, but it would be like warming up a lake, so it would not be very cost effective.
						</p>
						<p>
							Surfing has been blessed with wetsuits and wearing a wetsuit is normal for the majority of the surfing community.

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Is it easier to learn to surf in a surf pool than it is in the ocean?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							Yes, it is actually. In normal surfing conditions are ever changing, resulting in unpredictable schedules and complex wave variations. That’s why surfers need so much time in the ocean to master even the most basic skills. In a pool however, all these variables are eliminated, so you can focus entirely on your technique and improve quickly because you can repeat the moves over and over again. Just like training in a tennis court: the canvas is there, you just put in your time and focus.

				<span class="simple-accordion-title">
					Do you have to know how to surf before entering the pool?
				</span>
				<div class="simple-accordion-inner">
					<div class="target">
						<p>
							No you don’t. Beginners can learn at the smaller breaks on the secondary break, advanced surfers will be attracted to the primary break with bigger, more challenging waves.
						</p>
